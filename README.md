# Palm OS Win32 Conduit Installer

This conduit installer was created to ease Win32 -> Palm OS HotSync Manager conduit installation for Stand Alone, Inc.'s  sync-compatible apps and, yes, it was authored using Perl via `Win32::GUI` and `Win32::GUI::Loft::Design`.

## Why would you do this?!

At the time I was a fledging web dev and I was having fun pushing Perl's capabilities. I probably just wanted to show that it could be done, and no one said 'no'.

Also, we were predominantly an Apple-based development shop and I was the only one using Windows daily.

## Does it still work?

As far as I know, the installers will still work under Win98/Windows 2000.

However, I would not suggest attempting to roll-your-own installer using this repo. The repo lacks the necessary assets/pacakge data to build an installer.

## Why make this available?

It's one of the strangest dev projects I've undertaken! As I type this, the installers are still available via the app archives at:

https://standalone.com/palmos

Apps that use the installer include:

- Auto Slate
- Crossword Puzzles
- Password Store
- Hand/RSS
- Quick News
- Workout Tracker

Simply put? I'm still shocked that I made it and that it worked until we ceased Palm OS 5.x development.
